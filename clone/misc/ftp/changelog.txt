This file contains detailed changes made to the latest beta releases

Build 640
- Minor bug fixes

Build 639
- Minor bug fixes

Build 638
- Fixed menu placement glitch which effected people with multiple
  monitors. Special thanks to manik_d for helping me resolve this issue.
- After lots and lots of debugging we've eliminated a strange bug
  a few users have experienced. When queuing a folder for ftp download
  FlashFXP failed to display the active folder in the local view.
  Special thanks to Linkster for debugging and constantly bugging me 
  about this issue until it was fixed.
- FlashFXP will no longer retry files rejected by upload verification
  scripts provided the transfer failed reply contains the word 
  "rejected" (i.e warftpd) or "quota exceeded" (*nix shells)
- Added SITE <host> <port> to the proxy list, in doing so the order of
  proxy list has changed. Please verify your proxy settings.

Build 637
- Fixed, If the user enabled the schedule then disable it, then
  changed the start time to the current time FlashFXP would start the
  scheduled queue even though it was disabled.
- Added a on transfer complete selection to the schedule dialog.
- When selecting the desktop in the local view, the file sizes and
  dates now appear where previously they were blank.
- Added support for file listing with non-english timestamps, while
  FlashFXP is unable to display the correct date it is now able to
  display those items in the file list.

Build 636
- On Transfer complete: Turn off computer, should now work correctly
  under windows 2000.
- Reverted the local view dropdown path box to an older version as
  some users encountered an incorrect display of paths with the newer.

Build 635
- What would I do without Wild-Rose, today she comes to me and says
  she found a bug, I didn't want to believe it. Sure enough she found
  a bug. After adding/deleting/renaming a site in the site manager
  FlashFXP neglected to refresh the drop-down connect menu. With
  change there is always room for error, I rewrote some code to
  improved the performance of the site list caching with this new
  design a variable was used to determine if the list was modified.
  This variable was neglected to be reset under the above conditions.

Build 634
- No changes.

Build 630-633
- Resolved a rare problem where the local view would jump around after
  a ftp download. Sometimes even accessing cd-rom and zipdrives.
  Special thanks to BaHAmuT for helping me resolve this issue.

Build 629
- The local & remote view dropdown box and the local & remote treeview
  now make use the font styles defined by the file listing font.
  i.e. If the user selected bold the text wasn't displayed in bold.

Build 627-628
- No changes.

Build 626
- Fixed a bug where if the site manager only contains one site and
  the user deletes it, attempting to add a site would cause an access
  violation.

Build 625
- Improved handling for ftp urls with % sequences.
- Fixed a bug where FlashFXP would sometimes prevent the user from
  moving an item to the top of the queue, it would only allow the
  second position.

Build 624
- Minor improvements to the local view and improved error handling.

Build 623
- Fixed a strange problem were FlashFXP would sometimes hang at 99%
  on ftp uploads.
- Fixed another strange problem which caused FlashFXP to AV on exit.
- Fixed a bug where having a list sort direction of descending
  caused a "List index out of bounds (0)" on start up.

Build 621-622
- No changes.

Build 620
- The user can now define the default column sort for the local
  view via the Preferences | Display tab.

Build 619
- Fixed a list parsing error with Windows NT FTPD which caused
  file names with excess spaces to be truncated.
- Sorry everyone, It seems when I tweaked the status window
  I overlooked the user defined background color, which causes
  the text to have a default window background on top of your
  custom background color. ewwwww very unattractive.

Build 618
- It seems sometime during the last couple builds I accidently
  striped the line feeds from the copy selection of the status
  window, this has been corrected.
- I've improved many aspects of the status display, reducing
  some overhead and memory usage, and gained a bit of speed.
- FlashFXP should now correctly shutdown Windows 2000.

Build 617
- Under some circumstances when doing a site to site transfer and
  both sites error, FlashFXP would end up in a loop of switching
  between normal and alternative FXP.
- Resolved several issues with the internal editor under win2k.
- The layout for the file view/edit extension dialog has been
  modified for ease of use.

Build 616
- FlashFXP should now display folders/files which end in a space
  correctly.

Build 615
- No changes.

Build 614
- Under some circumstances the associated file icon for an item in
  the queue was not being displayed.
- I've made some changes to how FlashFXP cleans up on exit, hopefully
  this resolves the random errors on exit that a few people have
  reported.

Build 613
- The FTP Directory Tree has been reverted back to the old style
  where a single click changes the current directory, however I've
  also added "Double click changes FTP Directory Tree" to the
  Options Tab.

Build 612
- Once again we're using UPX v1.01, the last several builds utilized
  PE Compact and some users reported a conflict with AVP causing
  FlashFXP to take an extra long time to load up.
  AVP is looking into it.

Build 611
- No changes.

Build 610
- It was brought to my attention that you couldn't drag drop from the
  remote treeview to the local listview, Support has been added to
  allow this.

Build 609
- Resolved several display issues when using windows large fonts.

Builds 604-608
- No changes.

Build 603
- When entering a url from the quick connect that contains a hex
  escape syntax (i.e %20), FlashFXP first attempts to change into
  the directory, but if it fails, it then converts the hex escape
  syntax into the true characters and attempts to change into that.

Build 602
- Fixed a problem with Calculate disk space not changing back to the
  original path once completed.
- The FTP transfer progress bar is now made up of two colors. when
  resuming a file the percentage already transferred is displayed in a
  dark yellow, while the new progress will be displayed in yellow,
  this will give the user a better idea of how much has transferred
  since the file was resumed.

Build 600-601
- Tweaked the popup menu, It shouldn't disappear anymore.

Build 598-599
- No changes.

Build 597
- Pressing Abort a second time in the Calculate Space Used dialog
  forces an abort.

Build 596
- Resolved several minor problems related to the pop up menus.
  Thanks Wild-Rose for helping me.
- On the On Transfer Complete menu Disconnect Site(s) and Quit
  FlashFXP were reversed. Thanks again Wild-Rose =)
- Changed CHMOD, you can now manually enter the file mode.

Build 595
- It seems also double-clicking the status window cleared the
  clipboard.

Build 594
- The List Queue now utilizes system icons for the files/folders
  icons.
- Pressing Cancel on the Copy Url dialog no longer reports invalid
  password.

Build 593
- If the user compares folders during a transfer it messed up the
  transfer progress bar because they both use the same progress bar.
  The compare folder progress bar is now suppressed during transfers.

Build 591
- When double-clicking the status window sometimes it would copy the
  text below the cursor to the clipboard, this was not the intended
  effect and has been resolved.
- Under some circumstances the file transfer mode was not set
  correctly, I am very positive that it has been completed fixed.

Builds 589-590
- No significant changes

Build 588
- Added Confirmation to save changed to an edited site in the site
  manager. By default this will be enabled, you can disable it via
  the Preferences on the Options tab.

Build 587
- Several improvements made to the internal editor.

Build 586
- No significant changes

Build 585
- When renaming a site in the Site Manager it now supports simple case
  manipulation, previously this reported an error saying the site
  already existed. Reported by Raccoon.
- After adding a site in the Site Manager, Attempting to delete it
  before pressing Apply would result in the site not being deleted.
  This has been resolved. Reported by Raccoon.

Builds 580-584
- No significant changes

Build 579
- Fixed remote view sort, it wasn't sorting by the value set in the
  Preferences on start up.
- Cleaned up the sorting routine code.

Build 578
- No changes

Build 577
- Fixed left side bookmark popup. I was tinkering around with my
  code and forgot to revert things back to the working method.

Build 576
- Fixed Access violation when starting flashfxp or closing the
  preferences, this was caused when the local view was set to
  a directory which was empty.

Build 575
- Under some conditions right clicking the status window cleared the
  clipboard. Reported by Whoppie.
- Back in build 561 I found out that I had to set the transfer mode
  before getting the current file size when uploading, This caused
  a hidden problem where sometimes FlashFXP was not setting the
  correct transfer mode. Reported by Usurper.

Build 574
- Added support to handle "MACOS Peter's Server" PASV replies which
  are non-standard.
- Well it seems that change made back in build 561 "Recursive queuing
  is now handled differently" caused another problem with GLFTPD,
  where spaces are replaced with a "_". This has been corrected.
  Reported by Usurper.

Build 573
- If FlashFXP fails to make a directory it no longer tries to remove
  it if 'clean up empty directories' is enabled.

Build 572
- No changes

Build 571
- No changes

Build 570
- When 'Close unused ftp connections during transfer' was unchecked
  and the user is connected to two sites doing a local download on the
  left side, if the right ftp is disconnected the status bar is wiped
  out. Thanks Raccoon for pointing this out
  .
- Corrected the proxy types as some of the descriptions were reversed.

- To resolve a problem with using %[] in custom commands, %[] is only
  treated as a variable if the line contains a %d. Since %[] can only
  be used in conjunction with %d dialogs.

- That change made back in build 561 "Recursive queuing is now handled
  differently" was case sensitive and caused some problems on GLFTPD
  since it forces the first letter of the folder name as uppercase.
  Reported by Usurper.

Build 569
- No changes

Build 568
- Major memory leak found and resolved. The option 'Flash window on
  transfer complete' also flashes the tray icon when FlashFXP is
  minimized to the system tray. The icon used for the flash effect was
  not correctly handled causing a leak every time it flashed.

Build 567
- Drives that return -1 as the free space (usually network drives)
  now bypass the 'Check free space on download' option.
  Thanks Wild-Rose for pointing this out.

Build 566
- It appears the default ASCII file extension list did not initialize
  until after the user opened the ASCII file extension dialog and
  clicked OK. Thanks Peter for pointing this out.

Build 565
- Minor code improvements here and there.

Build 564
- There must be a conspiracy against me! 3 different people asked me
  to allow them to change the 'On Ask wait 30 seconds then overwrite'
  on the file exist options dialog in the past 24hrs.. Ok.. Ok.. its
  now user defined.

Build 563
- Improved abort handling to calculate space used

- When entering a directory in local view it now selects the first
  item unless your backing out of a previous directory in that case
  the previous directory is selected.

Build 562
- Added close button to the check space used dialog.

- Toggling visible list view columns is now done by right clicking on
  the column header and selecting customize. (Local view can be
  customized too!)

Build 561
- Recursive queuing is now handled differently, as pointed out to me
  by Usurper the existing method was crap.

  Here is an example of how the existing way works using fxp, you
  queue a folder on site 1, it enters the folder and queues the files,
  it then makes/enters the folder on site 2 but if it fails it keeps
  trying to change into the folder for the remaining files.

  The new method, If you queue a folder on site 1 and its unable to
  make/enter that folder on site 2 all files queued under that folder
  are skipped.

  No point trying to change into a folder that you failed to create
  and doesn't exist.

- jaybee reported a problem with ftp uploading on linux servers.
  After extensive testing it appears there was a small bug with ftp
  upload resuming on selective linux ftp servers. FlashFXP issues the
  size command to determine the correct file size without having to
  refresh the listing. some linux servers return the size based on the
  transfer mode. To resolve this bug FlashFXP now sets the transfer
  mode prior to checking the file size.

- Rewrote parts of the local view (explorer) code, file listing should
  be noticeably faster.

- Rearranged the layout of the Restore Queue dialog so the options are
  on top, this should help prevent accidently toggling of the options.

- When local downloading and the file exist option was set to ask,
  selecting resume caused the file to be overwrote. thanks
  cyber_wizard for pointing this out.

Build 560
- Fixed another glitch in the unregister option.
- Fixed serious problem with renaming sites within groups. Thanks
  Raccoon for pointing this out.
- ok so I broke anti-idle, its fixed again.

Build 559
- Fixed bug in remote Edit, FlashFXP was sending NOOP during the FTP
  upload which may cause the transfer to hang.
- Updated Live Update server list, removed flashfxp.castlegardens.com
  as the 3rd server since it's history. For a trial period
  www.flashfxp.com will act as the 1st server. (faster?)

Build 558
- Numerous improvements to the local view (shell explorer)
- Fixed glitch in the expiration system. (first time users were given
  a dialog which said ffxp had expired) Thanks Noah for pointing this
  out.

Build 557
- Fixed minor glitch in the anti-idle.
- Added extra debugging for linkster who noticed a strange problem
  with the local view. problem not resolved.


Build 555
- Fixed a bug that prevented the user from unregistering FlashFXP.
- Minor changes to the site manager.
- Changed Internal Editor, The user can now use a different font for
  the Welcome Message/Other text.
